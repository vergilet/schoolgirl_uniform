Just another concept of Multistep form :feet: for Rails projects.

<br>

## Installation

To start using it just add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'schoolgirl_uniform'
```
<br>

Then you need to generate scaffold for future multistep form:

```ruby
$ rails generate schoolgirl_uniform:install CatgirlsSurvey
```
<br>

> You can also use snake case, so `catgirls_survey` is identical to `CatgirlsSurvey` and will generate the same output during scaffolding.

<br>

The result will look like this:

```flex
create  app/views/catgirls_survey/_wizard.html.erb
create  app/views/catgirls_survey/_form_errors.html.erb
create  app/views/catgirls_survey/show.html.erb
create  app/views/catgirls_survey/finish.html.erb
create  app/views/catgirls_survey/steps/_first.html.erb
create  app/views/catgirls_survey/steps/_second.html.erb
create  app/views/catgirls_survey/steps/_third.html.erb
create  app/forms/catgirls_survey_form.rb
create  app/controllers/catgirls_survey_controller.rb
 route  resource :catgirls_survey, controller: 'catgirls_survey', only: :show do
          collection do
            match :current, via: [:get, :post]
            get  :previous
            get  :finish
          end
        end

```
